* Research Interests
  :PROPERTIES:
    :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: heading
    :CUSTOM_ID:   interests
  :END:

  My current interests are in software architecture,
  computer science education and educational technology.

  - Software Architecture :: In software architecture, I am
    exploring the role of system dynamics in specifying
    architectures, for large SaaS systems (with my PhD
    student Mrityunjay Kumar, \cite{...})  and large scale
    control systems (with my PhD student Amar Banerjee
    \cite{...}).  I am also working on specifications of
    concurrent systems (\cite{...}) and shared data
    structures with my student Arjun Sanjeev (currently at
    Google).

  - Computing Education ::  My work is driven by the need to
    develop a pedagogy of computing rooted in formal methods
    and modelling.  Towards this goal, I am applying the
    Mapcode formalism developed by my colleague K Viswanath
    (\cite{...})  to undergraduate computing education.  Our
    goal is to extend the mapcode approach to interactive
    systems and applying engineering principles like
    feedback control, leading to /Algodynamics/, a systems
    view of computing \cite{...}.  I am currently working
    with students to develop various interactive simulations
    to demonstrate the design principles around
    algodynamics.  You can find some of these simulations at
    https://algodynamics.io.


  - Educational Technology :: I am the institute PI of
    [[https://vlab.co.in][Virtual Labs]], a large
    inter-institute project of the Ministry of Education,
    India.

	  + Systems Development :: IIIT's Virtual Labs
        Engineering Architecture and Design group [[https://vlead.vlabs.ac.in][VLEAD]]
        currently hosts the entire vlabs architecture and
        systems for the entire country.  *I am looking for*
        *students interested in systems development to
        contribute*.   

      + Experiment development :: My students and I have
    developed several virtual lab experiments in Data
    Structures (I and II: TODO: links) and are developing
    experiments in [[https://bhargavi-hash.github.io/OS4all/][Operating Systems]].

  - Programming Languages and Formal Methods for Systems  :: I
    have research interests in Programming Languages, Type
    systems, Compilers and Concurrency and Verification
    tools like model checkers and theorem provers.  I am
    looking for students interested in working in these
    areas.  The kind of problems I plan to look at are at
    the intersection of programming languages, formal
    methods, verification and systems.  If you're interested
    in Functional programming, you may want to read
