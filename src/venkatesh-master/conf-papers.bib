abstract = {When novice engineers (fresh or recent graduates with
                  little industry experience) join a SaaS
                  (Software-as-a-Service) product company, they are
                  tasked with comprehending the product, especially
                  its behavior and dynamics. We believe that they can
                  comprehend more effectively if they know and
                  understand the architecture patterns used in the
                  product. Are the current architecture pattern
                  descriptions of high quality? Do they fit the needs
                  of novice engineers? We evaluated the pattern
                  descriptions of Model-View-Controller (MVC) (a
                  popular and important architecture pattern for cloud
                  systems) from a quality and fitment perspective and
                  found gaps. To address these gaps, we have built a
                  System of Systems (SoS) model of MVC that uses a
                  transition systems vocabulary and a set-theoretic
                  notation. In the paper, we show that this SoS model
                  provides a rich set of information about the
                  behavior and dynamics of the MVC components and
                  their interactions. The model bridges the gaps in
                  the MVC pattern description. One of the
                  contributions of the paper is to provide criteria to
                  evaluate the pattern descriptions for quality and
                  fitment for novice engineers. The paper proposes
                  that we augment the benchmark pattern description of
                  MVC with an SoS model. The paper also demonstrates a
                  general approach to building SoS models for
                  architecture patterns and recommends creating a
                  catalog of SoS models for SaaS architecture
                  patterns. We believe such a catalog will
                  significantly help novice engineers in comprehension
                  and other software engineering activities.},

abstract = {Modern software products are complex systems and are
                  better comprehended when engineers can think of the
                  software as a system. Systems Science suggests that
                  learning about a complex system is aided by
                  modeling. It stands to reason that if we can help
                  novice engineers model the software products as
                  systems, it should improve their comprehension. One
                  way of learning through modeling is to use
                  Transition Systems to build models that we proposed
                  in a previous paper. This requires the engineers to
                  learn the vocabulary of Transition Systems and a way
                  to use it to model software systems. The question
                  arises: is it difficult to learn and use transition
                  systems vocabulary? We hypothesize that it is not,
                  because its vocabulary is small, and it builds on
                  the concepts learned in other courses like Theory of
                  Computation and Discrete Mathematics - finite-state
                  machines and set theory. To test this hypothesis, we
                  designed a short intervention (one lecture and one
                  project) in a software engineering course for two
                  cohorts of students from two different
                  environments. We taught them basic concepts of
                  Transition Systems and how systems can be modelled
                  using its vocabulary and evaluated their performance
                  on a modeling project. We also administered a survey
                  to evaluate their perception of the topic. Both the
                  cohorts scored well on the project and reported
                  agreement with ease of learning and use of
                  Transition Systems when surveyed. Based on the
                  knowledge demonstrated and the survey feedback, we
                  conclude that it is not difficult for them to learn
                  the vocabulary of Transition Systems and its
                  use. This result gives confidence to start designing
                  longer intervention to promote use of systems
                  modeling and study their effectiveness with large
                  software systems.},

abstract = {Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product companies have
                  brought in significant changes in how we build
                  software from architecture and engineering process
                  perspective. SaaS products are large, distributed
                  software systems hosted in cloud and built using
                  collaborating services (or micro-services). The
                  software releases happen in days and weeks,
                  necessitating an agile development process. Novice
                  engineers (those who join the company fresh from
                  college) need to become comfortable with complex
                  systems and proficient in agile delivery with high
                  quality, otherwise they fall behind in
                  productivity. The paper posits that, to be
                  successful at these SaaS product companies, the
                  novice engineers need good modeling and design
                  skills. While this has been for all software
                  development, the changes driven by SaaS products
                  have made this need more acute. Such skills will
                  allow them to capture their feature behaviors (in
                  context of their understanding of the larger
                  product) in an implementation-independent manner and
                  any knowledge gaps can be identified and bridged by
                  their collaborators. We propose a modeling language
                  that is easy for them to learn and use, and which
                  has characteristics suitable for the kind of
                  engineering work they need to do in their early
                  years in a SaaS product company. This modeling
                  language is based on the notion of Transition
                  Systems. The paper demonstrates the usage and value
                  of this language by creating a model for a real
                  feature. The modeling language is quite general and
                  transcends abstraction boundaries. We also present a
                  modeling process that should be used with this
                  language for better results. This is a short
                  position paper that presents an idea about a new
                  modeling language for a specific purpose (helping
                  novice engineers design well at SaaS product
                  companies). Validation studies for the language and
                  the design process is a work in progress and the
                  results will be shared in a full paper later.},

abstract = {An engineer in a product company is expected to design a
                  good solution to a computing problem (Design skill)
                  and articulate the solution well (Expression
                  skill). We expect an industry-ready student (final
                  year student or a fresh campus hire) as well to
                  demonstrate both these skills when working on simple
                  problems assigned to them. This paper reports on the
                  results when we tested a cohort of participants
                  (N=16) for these two skills. We created two
                  participant groups from two different tiers of
                  college, one from a Tier 1 college (who were taking
                  an advanced elective course), and another from Tier
                  2 colleges (who had been hired for internship in a
                  SaaS product company). We gave them a simple design
                  problem and evaluated the quality of their design
                  and expression. Design quality was evaluated along
                  three design principles of Abstraction,
                  Decomposition, and Precision (adapted from the
                  Software Engineering Book of Knowledge). Expression
                  quality was evaluated using criteria we developed
                  for our study that is based on the diversity and
                  density of the expressions used in the
                  articulation. We found the students lacking in
                  design and expression skills. Specifically, a) they
                  struggled with abstraction as a design principle, b)
                  they did not use enough modes of expressions to
                  articulate their design, and c) they did not use
                  enough formal notations (UML, equations, relations,
                  etc.). We also found significant difference in the
                  performance between the two participant groups.},

                  etc. continue to pose a threat on the modern day
                  web. Current browser security policies inadequately
                  mitigate these attacks. Additionally, third party
                  authentication services are now the preferred way to
                  carry out identity management between multiple
                  enterprises and web applications. This scenario,
                  called Federated Identity Management (FIM) separates
                  the problem of identity management from the core
                  functionality of an application.},

provide a promising approach to the problem of building large
scale, scientific Grid applications. Communication in these
component architectures is based on Remote Method Invocation
(RMI) protocols that allow one software component to invoke the
functionality of another. Examples include Java remote method
invocation (Java RMI) and the new Simple Object Access
Protocol (SOAP). SOAP has the advantage that many
programming languages and component frameworks can support it.
This paper describes experiments showing that SOAP by itself is
not e cient enough for large scale scientific
applications. However, when it is embedded in a multi-protocol
RMI framework, SOAP can be effectively used as a universal
control protocol that can be swapped out by faster, more special
purpose protocols when large data transfer speeds are needed.

  methodology in which a series of correctness preserving
  transformations are applied to high-level specifications
  in order to synthesize hardware descriptions.  In this
  paper, we sketch the key steps in the derivation of an
  example circuit.  The example illustrates several aspects

                  The system presents the student not just
                  with content, but an immersive experience
                  that allows both individual and group
                  annotations, versioning of the student's
                  work, custom querying, and a uniform
                  markup language to store content.  We
                  report the motivation and design of such

                  in the field of software engineering and
                  are referred to, respectively as
                  verification and specification.
                  Verification and specification are tied

                  call this model-driven design. The models

                  with exploring the use of PVS to formally
                  specify and reason with ER data models.
                  Working with a text-book example, we rely
                  on PVS's theory interpretation mechanism
                  to verify the correctness of the mapping
                  across various levels of abstraction.
                  Entities and relationships are specified
                  as user defined types, while constraints
                  are expressed as axioms.  We demonstrate
                  how the correctness of the mapping from
                  the abstract to a conceptual ER model and
                  from the conceptual ER model to a schema
                  model is formally established by using
                  typechecking.  The verification involves

                  automatically generated by the PVS type
                  checker.  The proofs of most of the type
                  correctness conditions are fairly small
                  (four steps or less).  This holds out

Transformations using algebraic properties of commutativity

We address the problem of efficient out-of-core code generation

physical memory.  The problem involves determining optimal
tiling and placement of disk I/O statements.  This entails a
search in an explosively large parameter space.  We formulate
the problem as a non-linear optimization problem and use a
discrete constraint solver to generate optimized out-of-core code.
Measurements on sequential and parallel versions of the
generated code demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

over large multi-dimensional arrays. Efficient computation of these contractions
usually requires the generation of temporary intermediate arrays.
These intermediates could be extremely large, requiring their storage
on disk. However, the intermediates can often be generated and used
in batches through appropriate loop fusion transformations. To optimize
the performance of such computations a combination of loop fusion and
loop tiling is required, so that the cost of disk I/O is minimized. In
this paper, we address the memory-constrained data-locality optimization
problem in the context of this class of computations. We develop
an optimization framework to search among a space of fusion and tiling
choices to minimize the data movement overhead. The effectiveness of
the developed optimization approach is demonstrated on a computation
representative of a component used in quantum chemistry suites.}

variants implement type reconstruction by building type
substitutions.  We define an algorithm $W^{E}$ centered around
building type equations rather than substitutions.  The design
of $W^{E}$ is motivated by the belief that reasoning with
substitutions is awkward.  More seriously, substitutions fail to
preserve the exact syntactic form of the type equations they
solve.  This makes analysing the source of type errors more
difficult.  By replacing substitution composition with unions of
sets of type equations and eliminating the application of
substitution to environments, we obtain an algorithm for type
reconstruction that is simple and also useful for type error
reconstruction.  We employ a sequentiality principle for unifier
composition and a constructive account of mgu-induced variable
occurrence relation to design $W^{E}$ and prove its correctness.
We introduce syntax equations as a formal syntax for progam
slices.  We use a simple constraint generation relation to
relate syntax equations with type equations to trace program
slices responsible for a type error.}  }

We propose a practical path-based framework for deriving and
simplifying source-tracking information for term unification in
the empty theory.  Such a framework is  useful for
debugging unification-based systems, including the diagnosis of
ill-typed programs and the generation of success and failure
proofs in logic programming.

The objects of source-tracking are deductions in the logic of
unification.  The semantics of deductions are paths over a
unification graph whose labels form the language of suffixes of
a semi-Dyck set.  Based on this framework, two algorithms for
generating proofs are presented: the first uses context-free
shortest-path algorithms to generate optimal (shortest) proofs
in time $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the
unification graph.  The second algorithm integrates easily with
standard unification algorithms, entailing an overhead of only a
constant factor, but generates non-optimal proofs.  These
non-optimal proofs may be further simplified by
group rewrite rules.
