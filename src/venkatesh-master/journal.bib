abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), robotics, the Internet of
                  Things (IoT), and automotive systems are integral to
                  modern technology. They are characterized by their
                  safety criticality, accuracy, and real-time control
                  requirements. Control software plays a crucial role
                  in achieving these objectives by managing and
                  coordinating the operations of various
                  sub-systems. This article presents a novel
                  Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) for control software
                  engineering, analyzing 115 peer-reviewed papers. The
                  study identifies, classifies, and maps existing
                  solutions, providing a comprehensive and structured
                  overview for practitioners and researchers. Our
                  contributions include (1) a unique classification of
                  literature into six research themesâ€”engineering
                  phases, engineering approaches, engineering
                  paradigms, engineering artifacts, target application
                  domains, and engineering concerns; (2) insights into
                  the specificity of approaches to target technologies
                  and phases; (3) the prominence of model-driven
                  approaches for design and testing; (4) the lack of
                  end-to-end engineering support in existing
                  approaches; and (5) the emerging role of agile-based
                  methods versus the dominance of waterfall-based
                  methods. This article's significance lies in its
                  thorough analysis and the high-level mapping of the
                  solution space, offering new perspectives and a
                  detailed roadmap for future research and innovation
                  in control software engineering. The findings will
                  guide advancements and best practices in the field,
                  underscoring the article's impact.},

Decomposition of functional behavior along system boundaries
into interacting sequential components is a key step in top-down
system design.  In this paper, we present {\em sequential
decomposition}, a method for factoring sequential components
from a system specification based on interface specification of
components.  The resulting components can be independently
synthesized, or realized using off-the-shelf components.  We
introdue {\em interface specification language (ISL)}, based on
finite machine semantics, to specify input/output behavior of
synchronous subsystems.  A component is factored from a system
by embedding an {\em implementation\/} of the {\em complement\/}
of its interface into the system description.  The {\em
composition\/} of a machine with its complement is shown to be
isomorphic to the machine, and the composition of a machine with
an implementation of its complement is shown to be a safe
interaction.  We apply sequential decomposition to a non-trivial
example, a special-purpose computer with Scheme programming
language primitives as its instructions.

operate on arrays too large to fit in physical memory. The
problem involves determining optimal tiling of loops and
placement of disk I/O statements. This entails a search in
an explosively large parameter space. We formulate the
problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and use a
discrete constraint solver to generate optimized out-ofcore
code. The solution generated using the discrete constraint
solver consistently outperforms other approaches by up to a
factor of four.  Measurements on sequential and parallel
versions of the generated code demonstrate the effectiveness
of the approach.}

address issues of both productivity and performance through
automatic code generation. The TCE is designed to take
equations for many-body methods in a convenient high-level
form and acts like an optimizing compiler, producing an
implementation tuned to the target computer system and even
to the specific chemical problem of interest. We provide
examples to illustrate the TCE approach, including the
ability to target different parallel programming models, and
the effects of particular optimizations.}

We propose a path-based frameworkfor deriving and
simplifying source-tracking information for firstorder term
unification in the empty theory. Such a frameworkis useful
for diagnosing unification-based systems, including
debugging of type errors in programs and the generation of
success and failure proofs in logic programming. The objects
of source-tracking are deductions in the logic of term
unification. The semantics of deductions are paths over a
unification graph whose labels form the suffix language of a
semi- Dyckset. Based on this idea of unification paths, two
algorithms for generating proofs are presented: the first
uses context-free labeled shortest-path algorithms to
generate optimal (shortest) proofs in time O(n3) for a fixed
signature, where n is the number of vertices of the
unification graph. The second algorithm integrates easily
with standard unification algorithms, entailing an overhead
of only a constant factor, but generates non-optimal
proofs. These non-optimal proofs may be further simplified
by group rewrite rules.
