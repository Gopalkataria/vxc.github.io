  abstract  =    {Many unification-based type reconstruction algorithms operate by
constructing and composing unifying substitutions in a
sequential, rather than compositional manner.  This
sequentiality makes the debugging of substitution-based
algorithms difficult.  We show two different
ways in which the compositionality of algorithms for
Hindley-Milner type reconstruction can be improved using
elementary results from the algebra of unifiers.
The first method employs a compositionality principle for
syntactic unification, while the second is based on defining
type reconstruction algorithms to generate term equations
instead of substitutions.  We discuss how improving
compositionality improves the quality of error diagnosis in
Hindley-Milner type reconstruction.}
