  abstract = {Algorithms are a fundamental part of computer
                  science education, with expressing and
                  tracing forming key aspects of their
                  study. Both pseudocode and code are used
                  to express algorithms. Pseudocode helps
                  abstract away specifics of the programming
                  language when specifying an algorithm, but
                  it can introduce ambiguities due to its
                  informal nature and does not support a
                  structured way to trace an algorithm. On
                  the other hand, tracing a program provides
                  a precise description but can conflate
                  algorithmic logic with languagespecific
                  details, obscuring the inherent structure
                  of an algorithm. In this experience
                  report, we propose employing the Mapcode
                  framework for expressing and tracing
                  algorithms. Mapcode represents an
                  algorithm as a set of transformations
                  between well-defined spaces, naturally
                  producing execution traces that are
                  independent of programming
                  constructs. Unlike traditional notional
                  machines, which model the execution of
                  programs, Mapcode machines model the
                  high-level execution of
                  algorithms. Mapcode traces reflect
                  underlying logic and are independent of
                  programming-languagespecific data and
                  control structures like while loops. We
                  report preliminary findings from two
                  classroom activities which explored the
                  application of Mapcode to express and
                  trace algorithms. In the first activity,
                  third-year undergraduate students drew
                  Mapcode Execution Diagrams to trace simple
                  algorithms already specified in the
                  Mapcode framework. We found that a
                  majority of students were successful in
                  constructing the diagrams. In the second
                  activity, students in a Principles of
                  Programming Languages course successfully
                  defined algorithms from various paradigms
                  (greedy, dynamic programming, sorting,
                  etc.) as Mapcode machines and implemented
                  them in Python and Racket.},
