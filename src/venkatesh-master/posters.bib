abstract = {The fixed control structure of deterministic algorithms
                  renders their behavior traceable but not amenable to
                  interactive exploration.In the accompanying poster,
                  we illustrate how the runs of a transition system
                  simulating a family of algorithms form the basis for
                  interaction and exploration. A student interacting
                  with a transition system controls its
                  execution. They are running a system, not merely
                  tracing an algorithm. The runs are easy and fun to
                  construct as pen-and-paper based classroom
                  activities or as interactive online simulations. We
                  illustrate the versatility of this approach for a
                  class of swap-based sorting algorithms and other
                  related problems.},

abstract = {Modeling software systems as transition systems can
                  improve system comprehension for novice engineers
                  and graduating students. However, this requires them
                  to learn the vocabulary of transition systems and
                  its use. We hypothesize that it is not hard for them
                  to do so. To test this, we did a very short
                  intervention in a software engineering course for
                  two cohorts of students. Based on the transition
                  systems knowledge demonstrated by the cohorts, we
                  conclude that it is not hard for them to learn the
                  vocabulary of transition system and its use. This
                  result gives confidence to start designing longer
                  intervention and study their effectiveness.},

abstract = {As software systems become increasingly complex, it is
                  important that students develop software-is-system
                  mindset. Our research aims to help engineers
                  comprehend architecture patterns better using
                  systems approach. We postulate that such an
                  understanding is aided when we enhance pattern
                  descriptions with a System of Systems (SoS) model of
                  the pattern to better explicate the dynamics. We
                  demonstrate this for Model-View-Controller (MVC)
                  pattern, a common architecture pattern for
                  interactive applications. Such an SoS model of the
                  pattern can also be beneficial in the
                  teaching-learning process in a software engineering
                  classroom.},
