* Programming Languages and Verification Research

My research focuses on *Programming Languages*, *Type Systems*, *Compilers*, *Concurrency*, and *Verification tools* such as model checkers and theorem provers. I am particularly interested in problems at the intersection of *programming languages*, *formal methods*, *verification*, and *systems*.

I am always looking for students passionate about working in these areas. If you're intrigued by *Functional Programming*, you might enjoy /Functional Programming for no Rhyme or Reason/ (and no, it's not generated by ChatGPT!).
