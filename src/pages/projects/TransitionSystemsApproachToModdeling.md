Transition Systems are a formalism used to model software systems. They are used to describe the behavior of a system in terms of states and transitions. Transition Systems are widely used in software engineering for various purposes such as requirements analysis, design, and verification. However, we are trying to understand if the Transition Systems Approach is hard to learn and use for software engineers.
