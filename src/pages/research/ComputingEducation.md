My research in Computing Education focuses on creating a pedagogy rooted in formal methods and modeling. This involves the application of the Mapcode formalism, developed by my colleague K. Viswanath, to undergraduate computing education.

Our goal is to extend the Mapcode approach to interactive systems, incorporating engineering principles like feedback control. This has led to the development of Algodynamics, a systems-oriented perspective on computing. Currently, I am collaborating with students to design and build interactive simulations that demonstrate the core principles of Algodynamics. Some of these simulations are available online at https://algodynamics.io.
