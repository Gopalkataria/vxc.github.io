My work in software architecture centers on system dynamics for specifying architectures in complex systems such as large SaaS platforms and control systems. 

Current research includes:
In the realm of software architecture, I am investigating the role of system dynamics in specifying architectures for complex systems. My current work includes research on large SaaS systems (collaborating with my PhD student Mrityunjay Kumar) and large-scale control systems (collaborating with my PhD student Amar Banerjee). I am also exploring specifications of concurrent systems and shared data structures with my student Arjun Sanjeev (now at Google).

- Over the years, I have contributed extensively to this field, covering a range of topics:
- Concurrency Control: Techniques and approaches for efficient synchronization.
- Distributed Model Checking: Verification of complex systems.
- Real-Time Systems: Ensuring predictability and responsiveness.
- Software and Systems Engineering: Foundational methods for robust system design.
- Human-Computer Interaction: User-centered design principles and tools.
- Workflows and Web Services: Modeling and automating processes.
- Data Modeling and Visual Modeling: Simplifying representation and interactions in systems.
- Formal Methods for VLSI: Applying rigor to hardware design.

These research efforts have been documented in numerous publications across renowned conferences and journals, showcasing both depth and breadth in software architecture.
