My research focuses on **Programming Languages**, **Type Systems**, **Compilers**, **Concurrency**, and **Verification tools** such as model checkers and theorem provers. I am particularly interested in problems at the intersection of **programming languages**, **formal methods**, **verification**, and **systems**.

I am always looking for students passionate about working in these areas. If you're intrigued by **Functional Programming**, you might enjoy *Functional Programming for no Rhyme or Reason* (and no, itâ€™s not generated by ChatGPT!).
